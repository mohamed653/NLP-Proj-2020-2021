Eduacation after covid-19 blog
Education has been immensely affected by the on-going digitalisation of everything the COVID-19 pandemic leashed upon the world. With schools closing down and universities moving exclusively into remote learning, teachers and professors, as well as pupils and students, have found themselves working in completely new circumstances.

In many countries, the spread of COVID-19 is currently somewhat under control. Consequently, some schools may be reopened and other educational activities resumed. However, we have not seen the end of the pandemic yet. Come next term, some difficult choices will have to be made regarding how teaching will be carried out.

In order to make sense of where the world of education is headed, it is first important to identify the trends that were already emerging before the pandemic hit.

According to Marianna Mäki-Teeri, digitalisation of learning was progressing at a speed even before the pandemic, particularly in the field of higher education.

“Ever since the turn of the millennium, the amount of open online courses, as well as remote degrees, have become common offerings of many top universities as well as public and private educational institutions. There has been an increasing amount of initiatives to use technology to make learning more effective,” she says.

Examples of such technology include machine learning and, in the field of remote education, telepresence. Additionally, the importance of data was gaining foothold in education, both in terms of programme contents and also in how it can be used to improve learning.
